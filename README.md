# Thesis - Implementing a Time Series forecasting of COVID using incidence and risk
We implemented models with Neural Architecture Search (Autokeras) and Random Forest (scikit-learn) to forecast COVID Cases in the Philippines

# Datasets
The final cleaned datasets used for model training can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ma-HdWP_xlbLLBu8EGPCFasVftkIPQjt?usp=sharing). This includes the main dataset and a dataset for cases only, used to measure the performance of the models.

# Recommendations / to-dos: 
1. Better NAS model hyperparameter tuning and implementing sensitivity analysis for better feature engineering 
2. Attempt ensemble modelling to integrate the other Luzon provinces in the model weights 
3. Try other RF configurations esp with the lags
